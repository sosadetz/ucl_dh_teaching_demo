**UCL Teaching Demo**

This repository contains materials that relate to the technical teaching exercise I described in my video presentation. The exercise has to do with vector space models and semantic search. Students have an opportunity to test and evaluate various sorts of queries, and they read deeply in material drawn from the archive. Pedagogically, this exercise seeks to impart an understanding of how vector models store semantic information. Students are able to compare different methods of semantic search, test the limits of my owns search engine, and see the importance of query strategy, text quality, corpus size, etc.  

Ultimately, goal of this exercise is to confront students with the fact that there is no one "best" model for search, and subjective human judgements are implicated, even in the case of sophisticated unsupervised NLP approaches.

You can download the material in this repo by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Download Zip". If you visit Google Colab (https://colab.google/), you can upload and open the `.ipynb` notebook. The notebook itself contains a cell that allows you to upload the spreadsheet of loading passages directly from your computer. In Colab, you hold `shift` and `return` together to run any one specific cell.

Again, I welcome you to visit my [search engine](https://conceptsearch.fas.harvard.edu/).

Thank you for your interest in my application!
